# Lightning + Intel Habana

This is starter project template which shall simplify initial steps for each new PL project...

\* the Read-The-Docs is failing as this one leads to the public domain which requires the repo to be public too

## To be Done aka cross-check

You still need to enable some external integrations such as:

- [ ] lock the main breach in GH setting - no direct push without PR
- [ ] init Read-The-Docs (add this new project)
- [ ] add credentials for releasing package to PyPI

## Tests / Docs notes

- We are using [Napoleon style,](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) and we shall use static types...
- It is nice to se [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) as they are also generated as examples in documentation
- For wider and edge cases testing use [pytest parametrization](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/parametrize.html) :\]
